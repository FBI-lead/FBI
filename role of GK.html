        <h1>Role of Goalkeeper</h1>
        <p>The goalkeeperâ€™s primary role is to prevent the opposing team from scoring by guarding the goal. They are the only players allowed to handle the ball with their hands, but only within the penalty area. Goalkeepers also organize the defense and often play an essential role in initiating attacks.</p>
