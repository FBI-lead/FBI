    <h1>Origin of Football</h1>
        <p>Football, also known as soccer, has ancient roots. Games involving a ball were played in China (Cuju), Greece (Episkyros), 
        and Rome (Harpastum). Modern football as we know it was standardized in 19th-century England, evolving from earlier 
        informal games. Today, it is the most popular sport in the world, loved by millions and played across every continent.</p>
